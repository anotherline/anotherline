## To-Dos

- build API and move server logic, accordingly
- app_server/_includes/appointmentLogic.jade: simplify appointments output by sorting it out by academic semesters, most recent to last item.
- app_server/_includes/appointmentLogic.jade: appointment semesters need a cleaner output, e.g., instead of Fall 2011, Spring 2011, Summer 2013, I want it to be Fall 2011-Spring 2011, Summer 2013
- app_server/_includes/publicationLogic.jade: needs conditional statements to account for other data parameters, such as available hyperlinks to works, or dropdown/pop-up feature if abstract for a work is available, etc.
- app_server/_includes/publicationLogic.jade: make sure all hyperlinks are Web accessible
